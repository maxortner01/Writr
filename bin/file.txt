The first time I talked to Jonathan, I knew I would never forget him. We were both in our sophomore years of highschool and only had one class together. I had never talked to him previously, but I knew all about him. He wasn't exactly popular like the football players were popular, but I knew him well enough before I spoke my first word to him. To most appealing charactaristic he had was his inability to feel put down. He could be considered a generally strange individual, but his confidence in himself made this trait unnoticable. Perhaps my borderline infatuation of him had mostly to to with this sole fact. He manufactured confidence like no one I'd ever seen. This, of course, on top of the fact that he was a genius. The only I'd ever met, in fact.
